# RaspberryPi-Fruit-Drums
This was for my CS 121: Computer Organization class

I used a RaspberryPi and an AdaFruit Captive Touch hat to allow the user to play different musical instrument sounds by touching fruit and vegetables that were connected to the different ports on the hat. The ports registered as user input which I translated using Python to play the music.
Here is a link to a video demonstration: https://youtu.be/k2LKkOHYW5I
